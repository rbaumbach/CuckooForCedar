CuckooForCedar
==============

Cuckoo For Cocoa Dev using Cedar.  This will be used for Cuckoo for Cocoa Dev blog post on BDD using the Cedar test framework. 

## Setup

This project uses [Ruby](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv), [Ruby Gems](http://rubygems.org), [Bundler](http://bundler.io), and [Cocoapods](http://cocoapods.org).  Get these installed on your machine and then do the following:

```bash
$ bundle
$ bundle exec pod install
```

Cocoapods is used to install the Cedar testing framework.  Once this has been setup, use the workspace to run the specs (CuckooForCedar.xcworkspace).
